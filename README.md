Simulator for Mathematician John Conway's Game Of Life

John Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton, a mathematical game that simulates the evolution of a grid of cells based on a set of simple rules. 

The Game of Life is played on a two-dimensional grid, where each cell can be in one of two states: alive or dead.
Within the simulator, white is alive, and black is dead.
The evolution of the grid is determined by a set of rules.
Each cell interacts with its neighboring cells (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally).
The rules are based on the number of alive neighbors:
A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
A live cell with two or three live neighbors survives to the next generation.
A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive (reproduction).
The evolution of the grid occurs in discrete steps called generations.
During each generation, the rules are applied simultaneously to all cells.
The Game of Life is known for producing various interesting patterns, including oscillators (patterns that repeat), gliders (patterns that move across the grid), and stable configurations.
The game can reach an end state in which no further changes occur.
Some patterns stabilize into stable configurations, while others may lead to chaotic or infinite behavior.

Within the simulator, you can specify the resolution to play at, as well as cell size and delay between each evolution.
